# Machine-Learning
Three small projects: ANN, Decision Tree and Dimensionality Reduction

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Introduction

The breif introduction of the project.

```
Three small projects uses matlab to implement Artifical Neural Network, decision tree
and dimensionality reduction.
The dataset is emotion data which contains six types: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.

The projects are to build algorithms or used built-in package in matlab to train the model and then 
evaluate these model by using precision, recall and F1-score.
